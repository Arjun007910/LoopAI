the repo link:- https://loop-8wrfo0182-arjun-sens-projects.vercel.app 
the website is hosted on vercel but it doesnt show anything because of no frontend.
I tried hosting on heroku but it did not have a free tier service , also github pages wasnt working and most of my time was spent setting up heroku.
